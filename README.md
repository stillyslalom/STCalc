This is the venerable [WiSTL shock tube calculator](https://silver.neep.wisc.edu/~shock/tools/gdcalc.html) with some updates (custom gases & gas mixtures, inputs saved and loaded from browser storage upon page refresh). Credit is due to Jason Oakley & Riccardo Bonazza for the original calculator, which has proved very useful for shock tube work over the years.
